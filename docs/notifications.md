# ðŸ“£ Notifications

The notification system provides real-time visibility into GuardDuty-SOAR's operations. It is designed to support both immediate human awareness and automated downstream integration through two configurable channels: Amazon SES and Amazon SNS.

## Notification Channels

You can enable one or both of the following channels in your configuration.

* **Amazon SES (Simple Email Service)**
    * **Purpose**: Human-Readable Alerts
    * **Use Case**: Sending detailed, richly formatted HTML email notifications directly to security analysts or response teams. The format is optimized for quick human comprehension.

* **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)**
    * **Purpose**: Machine-Readable Alerts
    * **Use Case**: Publishing structured JSON messages to an SNS topic. This is ideal for programmatic integration with other systems like a SIEM, a ticketing system (Jira, ServiceNow), or a chat application (Slack, Microsoft Teams).

## Notification Types

The system dispatches two types of notifications during a playbook's lifecycle:

1.  **`playbook_started`**: A brief notification sent when a playbook begins, confirming that an automated response is underway.
2.  **`playbook_completed`**: A comprehensive report sent after a playbook finishes, including the final status, a summary of all actions performed, and all enriched data gathered during the investigation.

## Message Formats

Each channel uses a different format, tailored to its specific purpose.

* **SES Format (HTML)**
    SES notifications are generated from Jinja2 templates that produce HTML. This allows for rich formatting, including headings, lists, and tables for maximum readability in modern email clients.

* **SNS Format (JSON)**
    SNS notifications are generated by building a Python dictionary and serializing it to a clean, pretty-printed JSON string. This provides structured data for automation and is easy for downstream services to parse.
